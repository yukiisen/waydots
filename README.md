It's quite simple, just copy rofi, fish and foot dirs to `$HOME/.config/`.

Install the required packages:

- fish

Build And Install `dwl` (Check the `config.h` file for more informations):

```sh
cd dwl
sudo make install clean
```

And finally start the dwl session:
```sh
dwl
```

# Notes
- You can find my nvim config on the [Xdots](https://github.com/yukiisen/Xdots) Repository.
- This is quite empty because I prefer to have more space on screen.
- Hyprland is for femboys.
